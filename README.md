# Quickdraw_data_classification

This is a notebook of my Deep learning project where I tried to classify drawings from the quickdraw dataset, 
which are drawings made by humans on this website https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/.

The objective was to train a model to classify the data into 5 classes : eyes, binoculars, baskets, hands and rabbits.
